## Welcome to the Podcast

I'm Charles Max Wood. I produce podcasts for the software development community. I've been working
on this podcast for a few months and now see the need clearly since most of the opportunities to
meet candidates face to face have been canceled.

My goal is to interview each of the candidates for state-wide office in contested Republican races. (So, if there's only one Republican candidate, I'm not going to interview them. I'm a busy guy.)

I also intend to interview races for the United States Congress in Congressional District
4&mdash;which is where I live&mdash;and Congressional District #1, where Rob Bishop is vacating.

Each candidate will have 2 parts to their podcast episodes. The first part will be a one-on-one
interview. The second part will be a recorded town-hall where people can participate, watch, and
and ask questions live.

All of this will occur virtually so we don't put anyone at risk.

I have a list of questions I plan to ask in the first interview. You can find them [here](/interview-questions).

The town halls will be listed [here](/town-halls).

If you have specific questions for the candidates' interviews or town halls, post them [here](/ask-a-question).

I'm trying hard not to let my personal views make much of an appearance in any of these events or recordings.

The views expressed on the podcast are not official Republican party stances and should not be
represented as such.

This is just one guy volunteering a bunch of time to help the political process in Utah.
